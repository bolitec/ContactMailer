This is the ContactMailer web application readme file
The first thing to know about this application is that it utilizes database session support.
In order to run it under normal sessions you need to disable the seesionConfig.php 
The second point affecting the installation of this app is that the database scripts all reside outside the public_html path.
The scripts mentioned above reside in the secure folder of the project structure.
